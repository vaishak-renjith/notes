### Forgetting
* Very common to forget basic info, details, names, dates, etc.
* Forget significantly more than we remember
* Reasons for forgetting/poor retrieval
	* Poor encoding -- not enough attention paid to stimuli at time of exposure
	* Decay/Transience -- "Use it or lose it"
	* Trauma -- Repressed bad experiences
	* Interference -- two types -- Proactive & Retroactive
		* Proactive -- similar older info conflicts with recall of newer info
		* Retroactive -- similar newer info conflicts with recall of older info

### Improving Memory
* Very personal, not all techniques are helpful to everyone
* Time to audit habits! Need to improve both effectiveness and efficiency
* Study early in the day, set goals, quantity, schedule breaks
* Basic health and nutrition
* Active learning -- writing and rewriting notes, not just reading them
* Distributed practice vs cramming
* Mind palace, mnemonics
